					<h2>About Me</h2>
					
					<p>My name is Ella Wight, I study Communication design at Victoria University of Wellington. I am in my second year studying and will be graduating next year. This photo I provided above is a photo of myself and my best friend at the age of 7. I decided to take web design this year as I have always wanted to know how to make my own website. When I was talking to my dad at the start of the year about my courses I showed him the web design course outline and he said “whoa, I wish I could’ve taken a course like this when I was at university. I would’ve loved to of known how to make a website.” I have thoroughly enjoyed web design so far as I can bring a lot of my commutation design strategies and skills into this class, such as doing prototyping and wireframes.

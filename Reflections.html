					<p class="blog-details"> For this tutorial, we were asked to pick a website we liked the look of and simply mimic our own version of this. I chose the Spotify website as my one to copy. As this lesson was the first time I had ever coded in my life, I struggled and needed some assistance on how to set up the documents etc. My learning process in this lesson began with learning how to set up an HTML and CSS file. I learnt that both these files need to be included in the same folder otherwise the browser will not be able to link the files together. I also learnt that the HTML document is used to create the content on the webpage such as text and the CSS is used for the style and colour of the webpage.

					<p class="blog-details">
						Git benefits each designer, organisation and team differently, it is one of the greatest current version control systems. Git is a distributed version-control system used for code, it tracks and saves snapshots of your entire codebase and allows you to easily deliver it to other developers. This means that every designer or team member working on the project has access to the central repository and can have their own localised repository. If your design team is using Git it would benefit your team a lot as you wouldn’t need to train new team members as they have possibly previously used the system before. Another server linked to Git is Github, this system hosts your code on a distant Git server with a web interface. It permits you to co-operate with other designers on the same server and it also comes as an app which can be used on your personal laptops at the comfort of your home. Designers that want to create a website or want to redesign a webpage should use Git as it has a feature of branches that allow you to rapidly prototype websites. If a designer was to make a new user flow or wanted to replace images or icons, making a new branch gives them an entire new working place to rearrange and change everything around. This lets the designers see all the different changes they have made on the different branches. Overall, Git is a fast and reliable system that works well with all the different sections in a business. Groups of designers should use Git for creating and sharing their websites as it will benefit their overall outcome.

						For this tutorial, we were given a blog template and told to further develop the blog our own way. This lesson was extremely helpful as it allowed me to work with a template that functioned well and allowed me to change the HTML and CSS document to how I pleased.  I realised I used Sublime instead of Visual Studio Code when editing the documents, I must’ve gotten confused with my other classes software.

					<p class="blog-details">
						For this tutorial, we were instructed to add a flexbox to a website, this means that when you view the website on the mobile phone or iPad the layout of the website changes to the screen size on the device. This task took me quite a while to understand but after playing around with the HTML and CSS i got the hang of it.

I found this task challenging as I couldn’t get the HTML and CSS to turn the page dark, I had followed all the instructions from the lecture but it still wasn’t working. I came back to it a few weeks later to try and fix it but it still didn’t work.
